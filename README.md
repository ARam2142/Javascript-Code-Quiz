# Javascript-Code-Quiz

Background:

I have built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML CSS powered by JavaScript code. Bootstrap was also used to design the application. It will ask a series of 5 questions to test your knowledge of javascript. Have fun and enjoy.

User Story:

AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Outcome:

This did take me a while to complete. I hit a roadblock when i had to write code for local storage. In the end everything has turned into a functional quiz app.
